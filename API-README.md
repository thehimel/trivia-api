## API Reference

### Getting Started
- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, http://127.0.0.1:5000/, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration.
- Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.

### Features
* Endpoint to handle GET requests for questions, including pagination (every 10 questions). This endpoint returns a list of questions, number of total questions, current category, categories.
* Endpoint to handle GET requests for all available categories.
* Endpoint to DELETE question using a question ID.
* Endpoint to POST a new question, which requires the question and answer text, category, and difficulty score.
* POST endpoint to get questions based on category.
* POST endpoint to get questions based on a search term. It returns any question(s) for whom the search term is a substring of the question.
* POST endpoint to get questions to play the quiz. This endpoint takes category and previous question parameters and returns a random questions within the given category, if provided, and that is not one of the previous questions.

### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:

`{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}`

The API will return the following error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 405: Method Not Allowed
- 422: Not Processable
- 500: Internal Server Error (This is very rare)
